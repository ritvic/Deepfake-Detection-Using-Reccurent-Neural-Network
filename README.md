# Deepfake detection using Deep Learning (ResNext and LSTM)



## 1. Introduction
This projects aims in detection of video deepfakes using deep learning techniques like ResNext and LSTM. We have achived deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained ResNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features.

## 2. Directory Structure
For ease of understanding the project is structured in below format

Model Creation
   - This directory consists of the step by step process of creating and training a deepfake detection model using our approach.
